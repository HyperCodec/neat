//! A simple crate that implements the Neuroevolution Augmenting Topologies algorithm using [genetic-rs](https://crates.io/crates/genetic-rs)
//! ### Feature Roadmap:
//! - [x] base (single-core) crate
//! - [x] rayon
//! - [x] serde
//! - [ ] crossover
//!
//! You can get started by looking at [genetic-rs docs](https://docs.rs/genetic-rs) and checking the examples for this crate.

/// This has state/cache and will run the predictions. Make sure to run [`NeuralNetwork::flush_state`] between uses of [`NeuralNetwork::predict`].
