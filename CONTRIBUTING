Thanks for contributing to this project.

To get started, check out the [issues page](https://github.com/hypercodec/neat). You can either find a feature/fix from there or start a new issue, then begin implementing it in your own fork of this repo.

Once you are done making the changes you'd like the make, start a pull request to the [dev](https://github.com/hypercodec/neat/tree/dev) branch. State your changes and request a review. After all branch rules have been satisfied and the pull request has a valid reason, someone with management permissions on this repository will merge it.

You could also make a draft PR while implementing your features if you want feedback or discussion before finalizing your changes.
